OpenCV
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products.
Here, I have just used some basic functions of OpenCV to play with a image.

The list is----
a. Read the image
b. Threshold the image
c. Contour the iamge
d. Convex Hull
e. Gaussian Blur
d. Show the edited image
